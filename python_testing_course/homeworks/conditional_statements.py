Day time shows before 5 PM -> 20% discount, after 5 PM -> no discount

Tasks:
a. Assign a hardcoded age of customer and a hardcoded show time (in 24-hour format).
b. Determine the base ticket price (e.g., $10).
c. Use conditional statements to apply discounts based on age and show time.
d. Print the final ticket price after applying all applicable discounts.
